Encoding different characters with different probalities with different length codes would help to reduce the overall number of bits used to represent a string of characters, since more probale characters, which are also more frequent when the student will write messages will be encoded with shorter codes, greatly compensating for the much fewer less probale ones which will be encoded with more bits.
An example of an applicaiton of this is huffman encoding, which is an old way to compress plain text data.
